# RaspberryPi_Car_Project 
# Components:
##  - Raspberry pi
##  - 4 electric motors with wheels (the ones sold for Arduino are the same)
##  - Dual H Bridge Stepper Motor Drive Controller Board
##  - Batteries and a baterry pack
##  - External recharger for the pi
##  - Cables
##  - Something to make the frame such as thick cardboard
##  - Duct tape
## Solder the cables to the electric motors

## Connect the battery to the bridge as well as have an extra cable to connect the ground to the Raspberry Pi

## Cut a a rectangle-shaped cardboard piece to use it as a frame and place the motors on it and make holes to pass the cables to the upper section.

## Connect the motor cables to the bridge which is connected to the baterry

## Lastly connect the Raspberry pi with the bridge as shown, using the 4 "IN" pins to control the wheels and make sure you have an external power supply that gives enough voltage for the pi.

## When finished using it, make sure you remove one of the baterries from the baterry pack to prevent drainage
